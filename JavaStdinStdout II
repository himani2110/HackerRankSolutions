        in java by clicking enter and going to the next line it keeps "\n" as a buffer due to the addition of an extra line. So in this code also 
        when you press enter after the double, it takes the "\n" as the string and hence doesnot print any value or input we give. This is why we add that extra
        input for the line. */
